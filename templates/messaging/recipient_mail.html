<p>Hello {{ message.recipient_name }}!</p>

<p>
    You just received a Happiness Packet from {% if message.sender_named %} {{ message.sender_name }}{% endif %}!
    {% if not message.sender_named %}The sender asked to remain anonymous.{% endif %}
</p>

<p>
    If this is the first time you've heard about Happiness Packets, check out What are Happiness Packets
    on our Website. <!-- Can we make What are Happiness Packets a link to the page? -->
    TL;DR: Happiness Packets are positivity messages that open-source contributors can send to each other
    anonymously and confidentially. By sending Happiness Packets, we hope to create an atmosphere where
    positive feedback is amplified and accepted more than negative feedback.
</p>

<p>Your Happiness Packet contains:</p>

<p><em>{{ message.message|linebreaksbr }}</em></p>

<p>
    If you and the sender of the Happiness Packet both agree, we'd love to publish the message to our
    Happiness Archive (Link?) to inspire others from the community.

<p>This is entirely optional, we respect your privacy and only publish messages if both the sender and recipient agree.</p>

<p>Have a happy day!</p>
