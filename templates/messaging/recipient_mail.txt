Hello {{ message.recipient_name }}!

<!-- MA: Not sure what this txt file is for, but it looks like it matches the recipient_mail.html file, so if you 
are happy with the copy edits in that file, I'd feel more comfortable if you change this file (too many functions and
I'm worried I'll break something) -->

You've just received a Happiness Packet{% if message.sender_named %} from {{ message.sender_name }}{% endif %}!{% if not message.sender_named %}The sender asked to remain anonymous.{% endif %}

If this is the first time you've heard about Happiness Packets # TODO insert brief

Here's what they wrote:
---------------------
{{ message.message }}
---------------------

We'd like to be able to publish some of the Happiness Packets, but we'll
only do so after opt-in of both you and the sender. To give permission for
this, please go to:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'messaging:recipient_message_update' identifier=message.identifier token=message.recipient_email_token %}
This is entirely optional.
