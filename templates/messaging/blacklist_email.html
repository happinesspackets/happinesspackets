    <p>
        If you don't want to receive e-mail messages to <em>{{ email }}</em> ever again, confirm by
        clicking the <b>Never email me again</b> button. If anyone tries to use this email address
        for a sender or recipient, the system notifies them that we cannot send messages to this address.

    <p>
        You might still receive Happiness Packets that were already sent before you select to block
        your email address.
